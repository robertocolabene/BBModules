# BBModules

### Version
That's a free alpha version. This kind of Modded VCO will remain free, most of the functions to add will be included in the complete version.<br>

#### Attention
NEED a developer for linux.<br>
The developer will be always the same but he can't public the source code. Obviously he will have all my modules for free. <br>
Thanks to Jeremy for the help with mac environment.

### To do
- add theta, phase modulation<br>
- add phase shifting for <b>sSRCbP</b><br>
- add I/O phase modding<br>
- add quantized tuning<br>

### Bugs
<b>Needed help</b> for a bug, <a href="https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/525">here</a>'s the link with an explanation of the problem<br>

## Modded VCO

<b>SIN, TRI, SAW, SQR, SPECIAL</b> knobs - to control the amount for each signal;<br>
<b>out</b> - it's the sum of all the 5 signals;<br>
<b>clone</b> - it's the sum of all the 5 signals not controlled by fine knob;<br>
<b>spl</b> - it's the sum of 5 not conventional waves;<br>

SPECIAL from <b>out</b> and SPECIAL from <b>spl</b> are different waves<br>

<b>sSRCbP</b> stands for <b>source signal replacement controlled by phase</b> (I have to find a name)

<b>alpha</b> - to control the source to modulate<br>
<b>beta</b> - to control the group of signals to replace<br>
<b>mphs</b> - it's the out for phase modding<br>
<b>omega</b> - to control the amount of <b>sSRCbP</b><br>

## Context Menu
### Input Mode

- <b>Standard</b>: fm and sync are properly dedicated to their function<br>
- <b>Alpha-Beta Mod</b>: fm and sync are dedicated to modulate alpha and beta parameters<br>
- <b>Special Amount Mod</b>: fm it's dedicated to modulate the SPECIAL knob and fmcv to control the amount<br>
- <b>Omega-Beta Mod</b>: fm and sync are dedicated to modulate omega and beta parameters and fmcv to control the amount for omega<br>
