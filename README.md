<b>SIN, TRI, SAW, SQR, SPECIAL</b> knobs - to control the amount for each signal;<br>
<b>out</b> - it's the sum of all the 5 signals;<br>
<b>clone</b> - it's the sum of all the 5 signals not controlled by fine knob;<br>
<b>spl</b> - it's the sum of 5 not conventional waves;<br>

SPECIAL from 'out' and SPECIAL from 'spl' are different waves

phase modding doesn't stand for phase modulation,<br>
it can be called source replacement controlled by phase (I have to find a name)

<b>alpha</b> - to control the source to modulate<br>
<b>beta</b> - to control the group of signals to replace<br>
<b>mphs</b> - it's the out for phase modding<br>
