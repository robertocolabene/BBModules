# Complex Oscillator

Let's figure out how it works.

## Quickstart Guide

![alt text](img/1.png)<br>
I'm starting analyzing the |o| output.<br> 
![alt text](img/2.png)<br>
first of all let's bring ö| to zero, so we can see the source signal... the carrier that will be modulated<br>
the first wave it's a sine, let's take a look to the others...<br>

pay attention: I'm moving the ã| knob to chose the carrier<br>

those are all the waves you can "modulate", but replaced it's the right term.<br>

I'm using the sine because it's the most efficient waves to explain this thing,<br>
just divide the signal in four stages, by the pole and by the trend...<br>
in other terms have a visual of the signal when it's positive/negative and when it's rising/falling,<br>
I called those stage, that you see on a sine, I,II,III,IV<br>
![alt text](img/10.png)<br>
the switch near ḅ| it's used to chose the stage and the wave, choosen with knob ḅ|, will replace the carrier<br>
first position - stage I<br>

second position - stage III<br>
![alt text](img/12.png)<br>
third position - stage II<br>
![alt text](img/13.png)<br>
fourth position - stage IV<br
![alt text](img/14.png)<br>
now we can really see how the ö| knob works<br>

![alt text](img/16.png)<br>
it's just a blend<br>

the ŧ| parameter allow you to change the staring phase of the special waves, it means that if you're using one of them as carrier moving the ŧ| will move also the stages.<br>
Remember that if the carrier it's a sine there are just 4 stages but if it's a special waves those 4 stages can be repated more then a once in the same period.<br>

At this point you should have clear ideas also on how modulation works.
