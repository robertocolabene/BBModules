SIN, TRI, SAW, SQR, SPECIAL knobs - to control the amount for each signal;

out - it's the sum of all the 5 signals;

clone - it's the sum of all the 5 signals not controlled by fine knob;

spl - it's the sum of 5 not conventioal waves;

SPECIAL from 'out' and SPECIAL from 'spl' are different

phase modding doesn't stand for phase modulation
it can be called source replacement by phase statement (I have to find a name)

alpha - to control the source to modulate

beta - to control the group of signals to replace

mphs - it's the out for phase modding
