# Complex Oscillator

Let's figure out how it works.

## Quickstart Guide

<b>I'm starting analyzing the |o| output.</b><br> <br>
![alt text](img/2.png)<br><br>
<b>first of all let's set ö| to zero, so we can see the source signal... the carrier that will be modulated<br>
the first wave it's a sine, let's take a look to the others...</b><br><br>

<b>pay attention: I'm moving the ã| knob to chose the carrier</b><br><br>

<b>those are all the waves you can "modulate", but replaced it's the right term.</b><br><br>

<b>I'm using the sine because it's the most efficient waves to explain this thing,<br>
just divide the signal in four stages, by the pole and by the trend...<br>
in other terms have a visual of the signal when it's positive/negative and when it's rising/falling,<br>
I called those stage, that you see on a sine, I,II,III,IV</b><br><br>

<b>the switch near ḅ| it's used to chose the stage and the wave, choosen with knob ḅ|, will replace the carrier<br>
first position - stage I</b><br><br>

<b>second position - stage III</b><br><br>
![alt text](img/12.png)<br><br>
<b>third position - stage II</b><br><br>
![alt text](img/13.png)<br><br>
<b>fourth position - stage IV</b><br<br>
![alt text](img/14.png)<br><br>
<b>now we can really see how the ö| knob works</b><br><br>

<b>it's just a blend</b><br><br>

<b>the ŧ| parameter allow you to change the staring phase of the special waves, it means that if you're using one of them as carrier moving the ŧ| will move also the stages.<br>
Remember that if the carrier it's a sine there are just 4 stages but if it's a special waves those 4 stages can be repated more then a once in the same period.</b><br><br>

<b>At this point you should have clear ideas also on how modulation works.</b>
